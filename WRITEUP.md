### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

Analysis:

VMware is a robust virtualization tool that lets you construct and manage virtual machines on physical servers. You have complete control over the operating system and virtual server environment when you use VMware.
App Service is an Azure cloud service that provides an easy-to-use and managed platform for deploying web applications. It supports a variety of programming languages, including Python, and manages system resources automatically.


Comparison:

Costs: App Service is often less expensive than deploying virtual machines on VMware because you only pay for the server resources that you really utilize. In contrast, VMware necessitates the upkeep and management of real servers and virtualization technologies, which might result in increased expenditures.
Scalability: App Service provides simple scalability by allowing users to increase or decrease the number of application instances. Scalability is also supported by VMware, although it requires managing physical resources and designing the virtual server environment.
Availability: With autonomous resource management and quick switching between application versions, App Service offers high availability. VMware, on the other side, necessitates initial setup and configuration effort, and recovering from problems may take some time.
Workflow: App Service facilitates and automates workflow. You can use your


Choice and Justification:
Based on the analysis above, the suitable choice for deploying my app is App Service. The main reasons include:
Costs: App Service has lower costs than VMware because I only pay for the actual resources I use.
Scalability: App Service offers easy scalability by increasing or decreasing the number of application instances.
Availability: App Service ensures high availability and instant switching between application versions.
Workflow: App Service provides an automated and smoother workflow compared to VMware.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If my application requires a specific environment that App Service does not offer, such as an incompatible library or dependency, I will switch to VMware for greater server control.
If my application must handle high loads and requires powerful server resources, VMware may be a better option because it allows me to configure and expand the system to meet specific needs.
